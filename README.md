# Detecting-suicidal-text-on-social-media-using-machine-learning-models- 
4.2 Pattern Project :)
Today, suicide claims the lives of numerous people
every year. The second most common reason for mortality for
people aged 10 to 34 is suicide. People use a variety of social
networking sites where they talk about their plans to kill themselves. As a result, multiple studies discovered that monitoring
social media posts can help identify those who are thinking about
suicide. However, finding patterns among writer’s texts that give
the idea of suicide is a difficult challenge. Consequently, it is
essential to create a machine learning system for automatic, early
suicidal ideation detection. In this research, an implicit model
is proposed to optimize the process using machine learning. In
order to obtain a satisfactory model, we went through numerous
processes in our work. To generate it, various machine-learning
techniques have been used including LSTM, LSTM+CNN, CNN,
ELECTRA and BERT models. In this study, we tried to develop
a prominent model that can identify suicidal messages from
someone’s posts. Among all the models, BERT provides the best
result with 97.71% accuracy in detecting suicidal texts
